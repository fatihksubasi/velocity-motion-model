## Ideal Velocity Motion Model

The ideal motion model implementation is presented by the function
motion_model_ideal(X, u, dt) in the file titled ideal_motion_model.m

Figure below illustrates poses of the ideal motion between the initial pose x<sub>0</sub> = (0 0 âˆ’ pi/10)<sup>T</sup> and final pose for time step dt = 0.1 and number of steps N = 20.

## Noisy Velocity Motion Model

The noisy motion model implementation is presented by the function
motion_model_noisy(X, u, dt, noise) in the file titled noisy_motion_model.m

Three figures below illustrate samples of the noisy motion for the final pose for command u = (2 pi/4)<sup>T</sup> , time step dt = 1 and number of samples N = 300 using different noise variances.
